# Last Oasis: Ubuntu Linux / Docker based dedicated server

**WARNING:** This is pretty much a WIP Proof of Concept. Use at **your own risk!**.

This repo might help you to run dedicated servers for [Last Oasis](https://lastoasis.gg/) on Linux and/or with docker.\
You should bring basic knowledge of Linux CLI in order to utilize what we got here.

## Installation

Download this repository either via git:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/deradon/last-oasis-docker-dedicated-server
```

or via plain [download](https://github.com/Deradon/last-oasis-docker-dedicated-server/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

## Usage

You might utilize this tool with a plain Linux (tested with Ubuntu 20.04), `docker` or `docker-compose`:

### Ubuntu

* Requirements: [Downloading SteamCMD](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD#Linux)

#### Configure

Copy the example config file and adjust it to your needs:

```shell
# Get repo (@see Installation)
cp config.example config
```

It should look close to:

<details>
  <summary>Example config</summary>

    ##############
    ## Required ##
    ##############

    # Get it from https://myrealm.lastoasis.gg/Settings ("Game server registration key")
    SERVER_CUSTOMER_KEY="XgZyB0HDYtv4JJ1tUUybXg"

    # Server name to use. Must be unique per server realm.
    SERVER_IDENTIFIER="Example Server"

    # Eternal server ip to use.
    SERVER_IP_ADDRESS=233.252.0.98

    # Server port to use. Must be unique per server realm and IP.
    SERVER_PORT="62001"

    # Get it from https://myrealm.lastoasis.gg/Settings ("Self hosted game servers registration keys")
    SERVER_PROVIDER_KEY="6fSIs5nTwnhfjcaVlZ5BmA"

    # Steam user name to login with.
    STEAM_USER="FancyAlice"

    ##############
    ## Optional ##
    ##############

    # Directory where to install Last Oasis. (Default: ".steam/last-oasis")
    # INSTALL_DIR=$(realpath ~/.steam)/last-oasis

    # Additional server options to use.
    # SERVER_OPTIONS='-log -force_steamclient_link -messaging -NoLiveServer -EnableCheats -backendapiurloverride="backend.last-oasis.com"'

    # How many slots the server should offer. (Default: "10")
    SERVER_SLOTS="25"

    # If you've compiled "stemcmd' from source or it is not included in your ${bold}PATH${normal}, you might need to set this to the full path of your "steamcmd" binary (or shell script).
    # STEAM_CMD_BINARY="steamcmdd""

    # Dedicated last oasis server steam appid for linux. (Default: "903950")
    # STEAM_LINUX_APP_ID="903950"
</details>

#### Install

When using the tool for the first time, steam ask you to login
and provide the 2FA code. That's because the Last Oasis server can not yet be downloaded
anonymously.

**IMPORTANT:** Whenever an unknown tool ask you for your password, check the source! Fight scamming and phishing!

```shell
./last-oasis install
```

#### Run

```shell
./last-oasis run
```

#### Help

```shell
./last-oasis help
```

### Docker Compose

**WARNING** Experimental!

* Requirements: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

#### Configure

Copy the example `docker-copose` file and adjust it to your needs:

```shell
# Get repo (@see Installation)
cp docker-compose.yml.example docker-compose.yml
```

**NOTE** Do NOT copy the `config.example` as this would overwrite your individual server configuration!

It should look close to:
